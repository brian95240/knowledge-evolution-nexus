- **Quantum Foundation** (29→30→10): 8,778x enhancement
- **Causal-Bayesian Core** (6→31→37): 5,040x additional
- **Evolutionary Deep Learning** (5→14→15): 5,334x additional
- **Knowledge Architecture** (16→26→18→19): 6,147x additional
- **Recursive Amplification** (39→40→41→42): 90,720x additional

### Infrastructure Stack
